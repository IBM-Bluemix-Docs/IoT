## Client connection URLs
{: #client_connect_url}

To connect device, application, and gateway clients to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} instance, use the following connection URLs:

### Messaging address

<pre class="pre"><var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com</pre>
{: codeblock}

### HTTP REST API connection URL

<pre class="pre"><code class="hljs">https://<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/api/v0002/device/types/<var class="keyword varname">typeId</var>/devices/<var class="keyword varname">deviceId</var>/events/<var class="keyword varname">eventId</var></code></pre>
{: codeblock}

**Notes**
- Where *orgId* is the unique organization ID that was generated when you registered the service instance.
- If you are connecting a device or application to the Quickstart service, specify 'quickstart' as the *orgId* value.

### Port security
{: #client_port_security}

Devices, gateways and applications connect to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} using either the MQTT or HTTP protocol. Connections can be nonsecure or secure.

|Connection type |Protocol|Port number|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Nonsecure*|MQTT and HTTP|1883 or 80|
|Secure (TLS)|MQTT and HTTPS|8883 or 443|

&ast; Ports 1883 and 80 are disabled by default for messaging. For information about changing the default setting, see [Configuring security policies ![External link icon](../../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/reference/security/set_up_policies.html#set_up_policies.html){: new_window}.

MQTT is supported over TCP and WebSockets. MQTT clients connect by using appropriate credentials, such as device authentication tokens for devices and API keys and tokens for applications. Because MQTT messaging to the insecure port 1883 sends these credentials in plain text, always use the secure alternatives 8883 or 443 instead. The TLS credentials are always encrypted when sent over secure ports. Be aware that you must enable TLS in the application (e.g., by using the `tls_set()` method in the Python MQTT library). Otherwise, the data might be sent insecurely.

When you use secure MQTT messaging on ports 8883 or 443, newer client libraries automatically trust the default certificate that is presented by {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. If this is not the case for your client environment, you can download and use the full certificate chain from [messaging.pem ![External link icon](../../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-python/blob/master/src/wiotp/sdk/messaging.pem){: new_window}. If you have uploaded a custom certificate, you may need to ensure the appropriate trust chain is added to to your client environment.

## Firewall configuration
{: #firewall_configuration .sectiontitle}

In order to connect devices and applications to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, you must ensure that any firewall is configured to allow traffic on specific ports. A firewall might reside on your local machine, on your router, or as part of your corporate network.

Ensure that the required IP addresses are open and enabled for communication.

|Region | IP Address|Messaging ports</br> (nonsecure) | Messaging ports (secure)|
|:---|:---|:---| :---|
|us-south|169.45.2.16/28* </br>169.46.7.56/29</br>169.48.234.208/29</br>169.62.202.128/29|1883,80 | 8883,443|

## TLS requirements
{: #tls_requirements}

Some Transport Layer Security (TLS) client libraries do not support domains that include a wildcard. If you cannot successfully change libraries, disable certificate checking.

Your TLS requirements depend on whether you are connecting to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} by using the MQTT or HTTP protocol. The following sections show the cipher suites that are supported if the default server certificate is used. If you are using your own client certificate, the cipher suites that are supported depend on the certificate that is used.

### TLS requirements for MQTT connections

{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} requires TLS v1.2. Ensure that at least one of the following cipher suites is allowed:

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

### TLS requirements for HTTP connections

If you are using the default server certificate, {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} requires TLS v1.2. Ensure that at least one of the following cipher suites is allowed:


- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

Increase the strength of your encryption by using the forward secrecy ciphers ECDHE or DHE in your cipher list.

## MQTT client authentication
{: #mqtt_authentication}

**Important:** Each MQTT client requires a unique client ID. If you attempt to connect a client in your organization by using a client ID that is already connected, the first connection is disconnected.

Devices and gateways that are connected directly to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} display a status icon on the dashboard to indicate that they are connected. Devices that are connected indirectly through a gateway are shown as disconnected because the dashboard is unaware of devices that are connected through a gateway.

### MQTT client identifiers

For devices, applications, and gateways to successfully authenticate, define each MQTT client by using the following client identifiers and format:

|Client type |ID|MQTT ID format|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Applications|a|<pre class="pre">a:<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>:<var class="keyword varname">appId</var></pre>
|Scalable Applications|A|<pre class="pre">A:<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>:<var class="keyword varname">appId</var></pre>
|Devices|d|<pre class="pre">d:<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>:<var class="keyword varname">deviceType</var>:<var class="keyword varname">deviceId</var></pre>|
|Gateways|g|<pre class="pre">g:<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>:<var class="keyword varname">typeId</var>:<var class="keyword varname">deviceId</var></pre>|

Where
- *orgId* is the unique six-character organization ID that was generated when you registered the service.
- *appId* is a user-defined unique string identifier for the client.
- *deviceId* uniquely identifies a device or gateway across all types and is analogous to a serial number.
- *device_type* is the identifier for the type of device that is connecting and is analogous to a model number.
- *typeId* is an identifier of the type of gateway that is connecting and is analogous to a model number.

The *appId*, *type_id*, *device_type*, and *device_id* values must be no more than 36 characters and can contain only:
- Alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- Dashes ( - )
- Underscores ( _ )
- Dots ( . )

**Notes:**
- When you connect to the Quickstart service, authentication is not required.
- You do not need to register an application before you connect.

For information about the format of shared subscriptions, see [MQTT connectivity for applications ![External link icon](../../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/applications/mqtt.html){: new_window}.


### Connecting applications by using MQTT

{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} applications require an API key to connect into an organization. When an API key is registered, a token is generated, which must be used with that API key.

The following code provides an example of an API key:

<pre class="pre">a-<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>-a84ps90Ajs</pre>
{: codeblock}

The following example shows a typical authentication token:

```
 MP$08VKz!8rXwnR-Q*
```

When you make an MQTT connection by using an API key, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- The MQTT client ID is in the following format: a:*orgId*:*appId*
- The MQTT user name is the API key, for example, a-*orgId*-a84ps90Ajs
- The MQTT password is the authentication token, for example, *MP$08VKz!8rXwnR-Q**

For more information, see [MQTT connectivity for applications ![External link icon](../../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/applications/mqtt.html){: new_window}.

### Device authentication

#### User names
The {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service supports only token-based authentication for devices; therefore, each device has only one valid user name.
A value of `use-token-auth` indicates to the service that the authentication token for the gateway or device is used as the password for the MQTT connection.

For more information, see [MQTT connectivity for devices ![External link icon](../../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/devices/mqtt.html){: new_window}.

#### Passwords
If the client is using token-based authentication, submit the device authentication token as the password for all MQTT connections.
