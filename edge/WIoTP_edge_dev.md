## Creating custom services
{: #create_service}

The default Core IoT Service is included in the catalog, and you can add custom services based on your business needs.
When {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Edge administrators configure {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Edge, they can select the custom services that you add, and then install them on the Edge devices.

As a {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Edge developer, you develop Edge containers and create Edge services.

Detailed instructions for creating custome services are coming soon and will be published here.
