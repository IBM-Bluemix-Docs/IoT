In this {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} getting started tutorial, we connect an IoT device to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

## About this task
{: #about .sectiontitle}  

Before you can begin receiving data from your IoT devices, you must connect them to  {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. Connecting a device to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} involves registering the device with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} and then using the registration information to configure the device to connect to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

## Before you begin
{: #byb .sectiontitle}  

Before you can start using {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, you must have the following items:  
* An [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/){: new_window}.
* A {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} instance.  
You can create a {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} instance directly from the [{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} page in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Services Catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/catalog/services/internet-of-things-platform/){:new_window}.  
* A device that meets the following requirements:  
  *	Your device must be able to communicate by using HTTP or MQTT protocols.
  * The device messages must conform to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} message payload requirements.  
For more information, see [Developing devices on {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSQP8H/iot/platform/devices/device_dev_index.html){: new_window}.

Explore the following options depending on your situation:

 | Device availability |   Next steps
 | -------------| ------------- 
  |**I have a device to connect** | Follow the process that is outlined in this topic. 
  |**I do not have a device to connect** | [Simulate device data](/docs/services/IoT?topic=IoT-sim_device_data#sim_device_data). 



## Step 1: Register your device
{: #step1 .sectiontitle}  
Registering a device involves classifying the device as a device type, giving the device a name, and providing device information. Then you provide a connection token or accept a token that is generated by {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

**Tip:** You can register your devices one at a time from the [{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com){: new_window}, or you can use the [{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} API ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/apis/swagger/v0002/org-admin.html#!/Device_Bulk_Configuration/post_bulk_devices_add){: new_window} to add multiple devices.

To add a device from the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard:
1. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click **Launch** on the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service details page.

    The {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} web console opens in a new browser tab at the following URL:

    ```
    https://org_id.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/dashboard/#/overview
    ```

    Where *org_id* is the ID of your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization.

2. In the Overview dashboard, from the menu pane, select **Devices** and then click **Add Device**.

3. Create a device type for the device that you are adding.

    Each device that is connected to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} must be associated with a device type. Device types are groups of devices that share common characteristics.

    1. Click **Create device type**.
    2. Enter a device name, such as `my_device_type`, and a description for the device type.

        > **Note:** The device type name must be no more than 36 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and any of the following characters: `_`, `.`, and `-`.

    3. Optional: Enter device type attributes and metadata.

        You can add and edit attributes and metadata later.
        {: tip}

4. Click **Next** to begin the process of adding your device with the selected device type.

5. Enter a device ID, for example `my_first_device`.

    The device ID is used to identify the device in the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard and is also a required parameter for connecting your device to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

    > **Note:** The device type name must be no more than 36 characters and can contain only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and any of the following characters: `_`, `.`, and `-`.

    For network connected devices, the device ID could be the device MAC address without any separating colons.

5. Click **Next** to complete the process.

6. Provide an authentication token or accept an automatically generated token. If you choose to create your own token, make sure that it is between 8 and 36 characters long and consists only of alphanumeric characters and the following characters: `_`, `.`, `!`, `&`, `@`, `?`, `\*`, `+`, `(`, `)`, and `-`.

    The token must not contain repeated character sequences, dictionary words, user names, or other predefined sequences.

7. Verify the summary information is correct and then click **Add** to add the connection.

8. In the device information page, copy and save the following details:

    * Organization ID
    * Device type
    * Device ID
    * Authentication method
    * Authentication token

    You'll need the organization ID, device type, device ID, and authentication token to configure your device to connect to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

## Step 2: Connect your device to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}
{: #step2 .sectiontitle}  

After you register a device with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, you can use the registration information to connect the device and start receiving device data.

**Tip:** Connection recipes are available for some commonly used devices at [Device connection recipes ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/category/internet-of-things-iot/){: new_window} on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}.com.

To connect a device to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}:
1. Set up your device for MQTT messaging and authenticate by using the organization ID, device type, device ID, and authentication token.

2. Send device messages to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization by using the MQTT protocol.

    The following information is required when connecting your device:

    * URL: *org_id*.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com

      Where *org_id* is the ID of your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization.

    * Port:
      * 1883 (disabled by default)
      * 8883 (encrypted)
      * 443 (websockets)
    * Device ID: _org_id_:_device_type_:_device_id_
    * User name: use-token-auth
    * Password: _Authentication token_
    * Event topic format: iot-2/evt/_event_id_/fmt/_format_string_

      Where _event_id_ specifies the event name that's shown in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, and _format_string_ is the format of the event, such as JSON.

    * Message format: JSON

    * Example payload: `{ "d": {"key1": "value1"} }`
