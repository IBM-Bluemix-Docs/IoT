# Historical IoT Platform data analytics
{: #historical_analytics}  

You can use analytics tools to view historical  {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} data and to analyze and learn from device activity in your IoT deployment.

{: shortdesc}

By using {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} with analytics tools, you can create various types of data visualizations to help you understand your device data. For example, you can create the following types of data visualizations:

 - Device Health Visualizations can be used to understand device population, such as the number of reports sent by each device, device types, event types, the number of devices reported in a specified duration, and the devices that are associated with a given device type.
 - Device Type Visualizations can be used to generate a visual summary of sensor data that is reported by all devices that are associated with a specified device type. This summary can include the average, minimum and maximum values of all sensors, a histogram of sensor output, and correlations between sensors.
 - Device Deep Dive Visualizations can be used to filter sensor data and generate information about a specific device.

## {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} and analytics tools

### Watson Analytics

You can use {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} with IBM Watson Analytics to visualize your historical device data. IBM Watson Analytics (WA) is an advanced data analysis and visualization solution in the cloud that guides you through analysis and discovery of your data.
 
For a detailed explanation of how to use WA to visualize and learn about data from IoT devices that are connected to the platform, see [Analyzing data by using Watson Analytics](analyzing_with_WA.html).
 
### IBM Data Science Experience

IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is a collaborative environment for data scientists to work to solve data challenges by using shared tools and expertise. 

For a detailed explanation of how you can use DSX to visualize and learn about data that is sent out by IoT devices that are connected to the platform, see [Analyzing data by using Data Science Experience](analyzing_with_DSX.html).
