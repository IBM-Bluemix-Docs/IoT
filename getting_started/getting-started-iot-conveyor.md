# Guide 1: Connecting a conveyor belt device  
Create a basic conveyor belt with an IoT device that sends monitoring data to {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Overview and goal
{: #overview}  
This guide is the first in a series to walk you, step-by-step, through the process of connecting devices to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, monitoring and acting on device data, and more. Each guide builds on the previous guide, and the sample code in each guide serves as input to the next guide. You can also use these guides standalone by modifying the sample code to suit your purposes.

In this first guide, we set up a connected conveyor belt and use it to send IoT data to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.
Depending on your skill level, you can follow one or both of the following paths to set up your conveyor belt:
- Path A  
This path gets you started quickly by installing a conveyor belt simulator app on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. The app self-registers a device with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} and automatically sends well-formatted data to the platform. Instructions for this path are in [Step 2A - Use the simulator sample app from GitHub](#deploy_app).  
- Path B  
This path is technically more challenging and requires additional hardware, Python programming skills, and manual registration of your device with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. Instructions for this path are in [Step 2B - Build a physical conveyor belt with a Raspberry Pi and an electric motor](#raspberry).

As part of this guide, you will:
- Create and deploy a {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization by using Cloud Foundry CLI.
- Build and deploy a sample conveyor belt device.
- Connect the simulated conveyor belt device to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

To get started with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} using a different IoT device, see the [Getting started tutorial](/docs/services/IoT/getting-started.html).
{: tip}

## Prerequisites
{: #prereqs}

You will need the following accounts and tools:
* [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/){: new_window}
* [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads){: new_window}  
Use the cf CLI to deploy apps and services to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. For more information, see the [Cloud Foundry CLI documentation![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/){: new_window}
* Optional: [Git ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://git-scm.com/downloads){: new_window}  
If you choose to use Git to download the code samples you must also have a [GitHub.com account ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com){: new_window}. You can also download the code as a compressed file without a GitHub.com account.
* Optional: A mobile phone on which to run the *Conveyor belt* sample web application to send accelerometer data.

## Step 1 - Deploy {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}  
{: #deploy_watson_iot_platform_service}
The steps that follow will deploy an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service with the name `iotp-for-conveyor` in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment. If you already have a service instance running, you can use that instance with the guide and skip this first step. Just make sure that you use the correct service name and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} space when you proceed through the guides.
{: tip}
1. From the command line, set your API endpoint by running the cf api command.   
Replace the `API-ENDPOINT` value with the API endpoint for your region.
   ```
cf api API-ENDPOINT
   ```
Example: `cf api https://api.us-south.cf.cloud.ibm.com`
<table>
<tr>
<th>Region</th>
<th>API Endpoint</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>US South</td>
<td>https://api.us-south.cf.cloud.ibm.com</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>United Kingdom</td>
<td>https://api.eu-gb.cf.cloud.ibm.com</td>
</tr>
 <!--<tr>
 <td>Germany</td>
 <td>https://api.eu-de.cf.cloud.ibm.com</td>
 </tr>-->
</table>
2. Log into your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account.
  ```
cf login
  ```
If prompted, select the organization and space where you want to deploy {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} and the sample app.
3. Deploy the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.  
   ```
cf create-service iotf-service iotf-service-free YOUR_IOT_PLATFORM_NAME
   ```
For YOUR_IOT_PLATFORM_NAME, use *iotp-for-conveyor*.  
Example: `cf create-service iotf-service iotf-service-free iotp-for-conveyor`
3. Create your sample conveyor belt device.  
 - Path A: [Step 2A - Use the simulator sample app from GitHub](#deploy_app).  
 - Path B: [Step 2B - Build a physical conveyor belt with a Raspberry Pi and an electric motor](#raspberry).  

## Step 2A - Deploy the sample conveyor belt web application  
{: #deploy_app}

The sample app lets you simulate an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} connected industrial conveyor belt. You can start and stop the belt and adjust the speed of the belt. Every change to the belt is sent to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in the form of an MQTT message that is displayed in the app. You can monitor the belt behavior by using the default dashboard cards.
The sample app is built using the Node.js client libraries at: [https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-nodejs ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-nodejs){: new_window}

![Conveyor belt app](images/app_conveyor_belt.png "Conveyor belt app")

1. Use your favorite git tool to clone the following repository:  
https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/guide-conveyor-simulator
In Git shell, use the following command:
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/guide-conveyor-simulator
  ```
2. On the command line, change the directory to the directory in which the sample app is located.
  ```bash
cd guide-conveyor-simulator
  ```
3. From the *guide-conveyor-simulator* directory, push your app to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and give it a new name by replacing *YOUR_APP_NAME* in the cf push command. Use the `--no-start` option because you will start the app in the next stage after it is bound to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.
**Note:** Deploying your application can take a few minutes.
   ```bash
cf push YOUR_APP_NAME --no-start
  ```  
1. In the *guide-conveyor-simulator* directory, bind your app to your instance of the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} by using the names that you provided for each.
  ```bash
cf bind-service YOUR_APP_NAME iotp-for-conveyor
  ```
For more information about binding applications, see [Connecting applications](/docs/services/IoT/platform_authorization.html#bluemix-binding).
2. Start your application for the binding to take effect.
  ```bash
cf start YOUR_APP_NAME
  ```
At this stage, your sample web application is deployed on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
When deployment is completed, a message is displayed to indicate that your app is running.   
Example:
  ```bash
name:              YOUR_APP_NAME
requested state:   started
instances:         1/1

  ```
To see both the app deployment status and the app URL, you can run the following command:
  ```bash
cf apps
  ```
Troubleshoot errors in the deployment process by using the `cf logs YOUR_APP_NAME --recent` command.
{: tip}
1. In a browser, access the app.  
Open the following URL: `https://YOUR_APP_NAME.mybluemix.net`    
Example: `https://conveyorbelt.mybluemix.net/`.
2. Enter a device ID and token for your device.  
The sample app automatically registers a device of type `iot-conveyor-belt` with the device ID and token that you provided. For more information about registering devices, see [Connecting devices](/docs/services/IoT/iotplatform_task.html#iotplatform_subtask1).
4. Continue with [Step 3 - See raw data in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}](#see_live_data).
