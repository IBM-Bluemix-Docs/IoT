# Smart contract samples for {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} integration on {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}}
{: #blockchain_samples}

{{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} integration uses smart contracts that run on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull}} fabric to write data to and interact with the blockchain ledger. The smart contract logic is written in the Go programming language chain code and is then deployed to the blockchain fabric.

## Writing contract code for {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} {{site.data.keyword.blockchain}} integration
{: #writing_contract_code}

To start writing and testing smart contract blockchain code you must first set up and configure an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Hyperledger environment. For more information, see the *IoT Blockchain Beta Exploring smart contracts* document in the  [{{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} blockchain Beta Program Community](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/groups/service/html/communityview?communityUuid=cf921b26-ee7f-4c10-a445-89d51d432fa1#fullpageWidgetId=W6b3a7a280b13_46e4_94a7_cabb83baaa81).

## Available contracts
