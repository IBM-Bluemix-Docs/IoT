# Managing user access
You can control access to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} by users by using the access dashboard.
{:shortdesc}

## User access
User access comes in two forms: guests and members.  Guest users have temporary access to the dashboard from the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organization, are added from the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} organization in which the instance of {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} is deployed, and must have both an IBMid and a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account. Member users have non-expiring access to the dashboard and can access it by using the `https://{organization_ID}.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/` URL. Members require only an IBMid.  

To add a member to your IoT Platform organization:
1.	In the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} dashboard, go to **Access > Members**.
2.	Click **Add Members** and enter the email address that is associated with the IBMid for the user that you are adding, then click **Add**.
3.	Add more IBMids as needed.
4.	Click **Finish** to add the members.
