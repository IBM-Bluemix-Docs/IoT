## Connect

{{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} Connect is the starting point for any {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service. Connecting devices, creating applications, controlling your devices, and interacting with third-party services are all available under {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} Connect.

### Gateway devices

Gateway device support allows you to connect devices to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} which otherwise cannot connect to the Internet, by connecting those devices to a gateway device. Gateway devices combine the function of a device and an application. Gateways can receive commands and send device data in the same way as a device, but can also send commands to other devices which are connected to it, in the same way as an application.

Devices which cannot connect directly to the Internet can be connected to a gateway device, and their device data can be sent to the gateway device, which can then send it to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} service.

### Device management

Device management capabilities are provided through the combination of a device management API and a device management agent installed on devices. Managed devices can perform device management actions which can be triggered through the main {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} dashboard.

Device management gives you the capability to reboot, download and install firmware updates, and reset devices to factory settings remotely, all from within the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short}} user interface.
